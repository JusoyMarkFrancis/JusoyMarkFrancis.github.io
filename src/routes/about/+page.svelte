        <p>I studied and graduated from senior high school in Cavite, where I specialized in Technical Drafting. After taking a year off from school, I enrolled at Gordon College in the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology program.</p>
        <p class="mt-4">Starting this journey with little knowledge of computers has been challenging, but Iâ€™ve grown to enjoy the learning process. Every day brings new challenges and opportunities, and I'm excited to expand my skills in the world of technology.</p>
